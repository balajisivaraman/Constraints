\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Code we write is always constrained, whether implicitly or explicitly
\item Making them explicit leads to better ways to reason about and understand our code
\item The more constrained our code, the more easy to read and refactor it is
\item Parametricity is the bare minimum constraint we should work with
\item Prefer typeclasses over inheritance if the language allows it
\item Higher kinded types enable a lot of reuse
\item Always reach for the most constrained abstraction, leaving the implementor with fewer choices
\end{itemize}
