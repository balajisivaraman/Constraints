\begin{frame}{Constraints Already Imposed By FP}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Immutability - Functions cannot modify global variables, throw errors etc.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why Are They Necessary?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Referential Transparency - Functions must produce same output given same input values
  \item Equational Reasoning - Function calls can be replaced by the values they compute to understand code more easily
  \item Ease of Refactoring
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
